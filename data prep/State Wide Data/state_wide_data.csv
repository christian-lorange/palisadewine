The vineyard, one of Colorado’s oldest, dates to a first planting in an old apricot orchard in 1981 and first commercial wine in 1988. As one of Colorado’s biggest fruit wine producers, the winery produces 10,000 cases a year, one third of which are fruit wines. The fruit wines are 100% Colorado fruit. Stop by the vintage tasting room to see why Carlson wines are so popular. Enjoy free samples of affordable luscious wines that stand as a signature of western Colorado. You’ll notice the not-so-serious labels, using local motifs such as prairie dogs and dinosaurs. Try the T-Red, made from the spicy, peppery Lemberger grape. Relax in the backyard and take in scenic vistas of the Grand Valley. Tours of the solar-powered winery, tastings and sales daily year ’round from 10a-5:45p except major holidays. Pet friendly. Located on the Fruit and Wine Byway, Palisade’s classic cruising and bicycling route.

Since 1978 we have pioneered every type of wine made in Colorado today – varietal grape wines, fruit wines, port wines, champagne and meads – and the introduction of our humorous label wine, Roadkill Red, in 1990 created a whole new category of wines nationwide…Sweet Red ‘Fine Wines’. Current sole owners Richard and Padte Turley bought out the last of the other 12 original investors in 1989, and with Colorado’s first female Winemaker Padte Turley at the helm we have won over a thousand winemaking awards since then. The Winery has grown tremendously, building from the minimal original equipment purchased from the defunct Ivancie garage winery to a world class facility which was recently picked by Wine Business Monthly as one of “America’s Largest Independent Wineries”. The Winery’s location overlooking the entire Grand Valley includes the last of the original ‘Colorado State University Four Corners Project’s’ test plot vineyards – producing Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes for the Winery’s use to this day!

After retiring from fast paced professions RN & Auditor….. this looked like a wonderful place to curl up and enjoy the beauty of the valley.

Evergood Elixirs,https://coloradowine.com/winery/evergood-elixirs/,"Wine made from lemons, not grapes? Years ago, there were just a few beer options. Now when you walk into a liquor store, you’re probably completely overwhelmed. The alarm bells started ringing 4 years ago: The craft beer industry is oversaturated. While craft breweries continue to increase, the market is changing. Many industry experts think we’ve hit a bubble. Why? ​ Much can be attributed to the new generation of 20 somethings who are finding their preference in adult beverages. Since 1992, their preference for beer has dropped 30%! So what are they drinking? Surprisingly, they are drinking wine, along with other non-beer drinks. Many wonder if wine is the new craft beer. Introducing Skier Pee, Snow Bunny & Switch Stance. Wine made from lemons, not grapes. Skier Pee, Snow Bunny & Switch Stance are true non-carbonated citrus wines, delicious and refreshing over ice. They take 6 weeks to ferment and the ABV is 10%. All are gluten-free, vegan, and low in sugar compared to “sweet” wines. Skier Pee, our “flagship” wine, tastes like adult lemonade. Snow Bunny is our strawberry flavored lemon wine that tastes like adult cool-ade. Some call it their “adult juice box.” And Switch Stance, our newest wine, is made from both lemons and limes and tastes like an adult spright or mountain doo. An instant margarita in a bottle! LOW IN SUGAR: Most sweet wines contain 3.5 – 7 grams of sugar per ounce. Skier Pee and Switch Stance contain 1.5 grams and Snow Bunny contains 2.1 grams! Skier Pee, Snow Bunny, and Switch Stance are completely different from Mike’s hard lemonade and traditional wine coolers, which are made from malted barley (which means they contain gluten) and have low ABV. In fact, some wine coolers don’t even contain wine!

The buttes & mesas surrounding Grande River Vineyards radiate warmth down to the vines to ripen the crop to perfection in late August through October and protect the vines from severe winter freezes and spring frosts. Grande River Vineyards was licensed in 1991 as the 5th winery in the state. They planted its first grapes in 1987 and fermented its first wine in 1990. Until 2006, Grande River Vineyards was Colorado’s largest grape producer. By 2006, grape growing was firmly established in the Palisade area. Grande River Vineyards owner, Stephen Smith, decided to downsize the farming operation. He sold most of the vineyards to local fruit growers to concentrate on making great wine. He kept ten acres of the original operation, with about five acres of Merlot and Petit Verdot, and leases back and farms about five acres of Syrah and Viognier. Today, the winery is one of more than 100 Colorado wineries and produces 5,000 cases of wine per year. Founder Stephen Smith operates this winery which began with grapes planted in 1987.

The farm and production facilities are certified organic and certified biodynamic. Grapes are hand-picked and bask in long, slow, warm-but-not-hot fermentations, thanks to native yeasts, those naturally present on the grapes and in the cellar. No commercial yeasts or other additives used. Fermentations complete in 5-6 months usually, giving the formative wines time to develop their aromas, flavors and weight.

Maison la Belle Vie Winery & Amy’s Courtyard,https://coloradowine.com/winery/maison-la-belle-vie-winery-amy-s-courtyard/,"John Barbier grew up in the Loire Valley in France, where his family had been making wine for the past 150 years. Maison la Belle Vie (French for “House of Beautiful Life”) had its first vintage from the 4.5 acre vineyard in 2006 that included Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and a Vin de Peche made from a Muscat grape aged in peach leaves and peach wood with a slight sweet finish, which is a traditional wine in the Loire Valley. Three years later the winery was open to the public and the wait was well worth it. Mr. Barbier’s experience and expertise in winemaking as well as an intimate knowledge of the arid high-desert region of western Colorado has helped in Barbier’s transition from growing fruit in France, to Colorado. The age-old practice of “dry-farming” is still used today in their vineyard allowing them to achieve maximum results by adding to the complexity and flavor of the fruit. Maison la Belle Vie Winery respects their vineyard and those who supply them grapes. They strive for a minimalist approach with their wine so the content of the bottle will always reflect an unmanipulated purity for the grape to shine. In 2011 Maison la Belle Vie added 3 Reserves, a Merlot, Syrah and a Petit Verdot all aged for 4 years and a walnut liquor that is a must have for the port lovers. Maison la Belle Vie (French for “House of Beautiful Life”) is a 4.5 acre vineyard, winery and wedding venue. Growing premium quality grapes such as Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet, Marechal Foch and Muscat.

Medovina,https://coloradowine.com/winery/medovina/,"Mead, or honey wine, is perhaps the oldest of alcoholic beverages. Simply put, it is wine made from honey instead of grapes. Like grape wine, it can be crafted with either a dry or a sweet finish. Medovina produces its own honey, from which it hand crafts its mead. Our beeyards are nestled in Old Town Niwot, in the shade of large cottonwoods planted nearly a century ago by early homesteaders. In what is truly a miracle of nature, flowers use photosynthesis to transform atmospheric carbon dioxide and water to nectar, a complex blend of sucrose and trace amounts of aromatics, essential oils and other delightful compounds. The bees gather this nectar from the unique flora in the Niwot area. The bees provide vital enzymes which break down the nectar into simple sugars. Inside our beehives, and over the course of several months, the nectars transform naturally into a consistently rich, premium honey. As summer gives way to autumn, Medovina begins harvesting the honey and crafting its mead. Our Old World process preserves the rich floral extracts present in our honey. Our meads are produced naturally, without filtering or added sulfites. Alcohol, honey and acidity are harmonized by producing our meads slowly, in small batches, and barrel aging them before bottling. Further aging occurs naturally in the bottle and full maturity can be expected in 3 to 8 years, but you do not have to wait that long to enjoy them. Medovina honey wine is a unique culinary experience, try it on a fresh palate: take three sips, then decide.Medovina produces honey, from which it hand crafts mead.

Monkshood Cellars,https://coloradowine.com/winery/monkshood-cellars/,"Monkshood Cellars is a young winery; which opened in 2016 with an old world philosophy. Monkshood produces Syrah, Chenin Blanc and Cider. At Monkshood Cellars we believe in the cadence of the natural process. The idiosyncrasies of each growing season paired with its fermentation determine the shape of the wines. These differences, both subtle and palpable, are a point of emphasis showcased vintage to vintage. That said, the fulcrum point each wine relies upon is picking the local Colorado fruit with acidity and freshness. Our senses of sight, smell and taste guide the decisions while science lends a quantitative backbone that reinforces each decision. Once the fruit is picked the primary focus shifts to shepherding the fervent fauna that governs the transformation of juice to wine and apples to cider. It is our belief nurturing a diverse ecosystem during fermentation permits nature to showcase its purity of place. At Monkshood we forego the use of commercial yeast strains or store bought bacteria, acid or enzymes, fining agents or filtration. We choose to rely on the natural fermentation process; reserving intervention if, and only if, a flaw is impending. The natural process of fermented fruit is to enter a secondary fermentation of Ethanol to Acetic Acid. It is at this time the focus is on wine rather than vinegar and we do in fact intervene. In order to halt this overly acidic fermentation, Sulfur is added. To retain acceptable levels of acidity in our reds the time on skins, or maceration length, is limited. This retention of acidity permits our wines to unfold on their own. Nominal, if any, new oak is used in the winemaking. Terroir of Colorado provides the essential progression of beautiful wines. Balancing mindful- neglect and the science of winemaking go into creating a noble & visceral personality in each of our wines.

Stone Cottage Cellars,https://coloradowine.com/winery/stone-cottage-cellars/,"Move to the mountains, if only for a day. Join us and discover why altitude matters. Brisk mountain air challenges the vine and imparts a vitality to the wine that compliments life at elevation. At Stone Cottage Cellars, our family crafts wine from grapes grown at some of the highest elevations in the world. With technique drawn from the old world and vineyards firmly in the terroir of the new, we create expressive, food-friendly wines to enliven and entertain. A visit to our tasting room recalls the ageless stone structures of old Europe. Over the past 20 years, the Helleckson family has lovingly constructed a farmstead and winery out of fieldstone cleared from the vineyards as they were planted. With your back against a stone wall, your feet in the grass and a glass of wine in your hand, drink in the vista of the towering West Elks peaks just off the edge of the mesa. Wander through the vineyard and taste Gewurztraminer from 30 year old vines. Should you decide to extend your mountain respite, join us for one of our occasional winemaker’s dinners. Wine is meant to pair with food and local wine pairs best with local food. Our home in the North Fork Valley boasts a concentration of some of the finest organic farms in the mountain west and provides the inspiration and ingredients for our farm-to-table feasts. Sit down to table with us and explore how good food and good wine, well paired, in good company create something more than either alone. The draw of the mountain vineyard is strong and may not be satisfied in a single day or night. In the tradition of the Italian “agritourismo,” immerse yourself in the vineyard life with a stay in the stone cottage. The first building created on the farm and the cask that held our young family as it matured, is available for lengthier visits. Launch your own expedition into the nearby mountain canyons and peaks. Wonder at the closeness of the Milky Way at night. Trace the dark side of the crescent moon. Pick your evening meal from the vegetable garden out back. Or just feel the gentle rhythm of farm life. Join us and discover the soul of the mountains, crafted by family.

Talon Winery,https://coloradowine.com/winery/talon-winery/,"Award Winning Wines with a Pedigree Talon Winery is known for classic style, fruit-forward wines made from the finest grapes available. Our methods preserve and enhance the flavors that develop naturally in grapes grown in Western Colorado’s high desert arid climate and mineral-rich soils. Talon’s founder Glenn Foster carries on a family reputation established at Sonoma Valley’s renowned Ravenswood Winery, reliably producing wines that are outstanding whether enjoyed on their own or paired with a variety of cuisines. Our vision is to marry Sonoma expertise with the vitality of the Colorado wine industry. We make local wines of the highest quality, brimming with the exuberance and taste that wine enthusiasts want to enjoy now. “Our goal is to share the joy of wine by offering wine lovers hand-crafted wines of the highest quality at a reasonable price” – Glenn Foster Our winemaking team is completely focused on creating authentically crafted wines that show great varietal character. For us, that means starting with the best grapes available. Our winemaking techniques are somewhat proprietary, but we can share a few insights. First, we ferment our white wines cold to retain as much of the fruity aromas and flavors as we can in the finished wine. This requires a chilling system and tanks with heat exchangers. For our reds, we ferment at warmer temperatures to extract the deep, rich flavors we want from the skins before pressing. To learn more about our winemaking, please call ahead to arrange a tour. All our wines, including Talon, St. Kathryn’s and Meadery of the Rockies, are made at the same production facility located at 3701 G Road. We look forward to seeing you soon!

If you are living in or visiting the Vail Valley, we invite you to join us in our relaxed atmosphere, raise a glass and share in our award-winning efforts. Vail Valley resident and real estate broker for more than 25 years, Patrick Chirichillo was raised in a long line of family winemakers. Living on the Jersey Shore in a multi-generation of Italians, he became interested in the winemaking process at the age of nine—helping his grandfather in a traditional home production. During this time, he learned more than how to cultivate a distinct wine; he discovered a deep-seeded passion for a creative process that promotes storytelling and sharing life’s moments with friends and family. These avid vintners produce wines that have garnered numerous annual awards from the Colorado Mountain Winefest Amateur Winemakers Competition spanning the past 10 years. And, in 2014, Vines at Vail officially became a commercial winery. We look forward to expanding our reach and winning more regional, national and international awards as we embark on a new phase in our winemaking journey.
